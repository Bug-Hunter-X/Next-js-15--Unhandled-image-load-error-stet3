# Next.js 15 Image Load Error

This repository demonstrates a common but not always obvious error in Next.js 15 applications. When attempting to load an image from a non-existent path, the default error handling might not provide sufficient information for debugging. 

## The Problem
The `about.js` file attempts to render an image that doesn't exist.  This results in a runtime error, which is not always immediately clear from the standard error message.  In development, you'll get a 404, but in production the behavior is undefined.

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` provides a solution that uses optional chaining and error handling to gracefully degrade the image loading process, preventing unexpected errors and application crashes.
